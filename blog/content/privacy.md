## Privacy and data collection

This website runs on Nginx, which collects access logs by default. These logs
are kept for 24 hours.

In order to store your theme preferences (dark or light), this website stores a variable named `theme` (with a value of either `dark` or `light`) in the local storage of your browser. localStorage does not have an expiration time and is not cleared automatically (unless configured by the user).
