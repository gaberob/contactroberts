In 2022, I've made a video in which I argued that replacing your smartphone with a 'dumbphone' to fix your social media addiction is probably not a good idea.

I argued that even though modern social media apps are specifically engineered to make us addicted and to keep us scrolling for as long as possible, smartphones also come with a lot of useful functions that make our lives easier.

Sure, by switching to a dumbphone, you will lose the addictive social media apps, but you'll also have to sacrifice things like Apple/Google Pay, public transportation tickets, predictive text input and GPS navigation.

Moreover, even though having a dumbphone 'to stay in touch' made sense 5-10 years ago, when people still actively used calls and SMS, nowadays, text communication mostly takes place via online messaging services such as Whatsapp, iMessage, Signal and so on.

Same goes for music. Back when people still used to listen to MP3s using wired earbuds connected to their phones, switching to a dumbphone wasn't that big of a deal. Nowadays, the digital music market is dominated by subscription services, such as Spotify and Apple Music. Sure, with many users discovering that their favorite songs or even entire artists simply disappear from the service, there's definitely an argument to be had about content ownership. But the fact remains – most users find the tradeoffs acceptable and prefer a streaming service over maintaining their own local collection.

Naturally, neither messaging apps, nor music subscription services exist on most feature phones. And those that do have them provide a much worse experience in terms of UI/UX compared to your typical smartphone.

Punkt, the company behind Punkt MP02, also maintains a Signal client for their phone called Pigeon. Even though this is a step in the right direction, being limited to just one, relatively obscure, messaging app, is still not optimal.

So what if you still want to take a break from aimless scrolling, be more present in real life, and still keep in touch with your close friends and family?

Well, an Apple Watch might just be the right choice for you.

## What?

Okay, hear me out.

Apple Watch already has pretty much all the basic 'dumbphone' functions:

* Making and receiving calls
* Writing short text messages
* Setting alarms, timers and acting as a stopwatch
* Basic utilities such as calendar, calculator, audio recorder, notes and reminders

But unlike a dumbphone, it also comes with creature comforts such as:

* NFC for Apple Pay and public transportation tickets
* Support for Bluetooth headphones and the AAC codec
* Support for music streaming services such as Apple Music and Spotify
* Fitness functions, e.g. measuring your heart rate, pulse, step counting and workout tracking
* Showing the public transportation schedule and itineraries with apps like DB Navigator and Öffi
* GPS navigation using Apple Maps
* Support for OTP apps like Bitwarden and OTP Auth
* Online and subscription calendars with ICS and Exchange
* Support for messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal and iMessage

And that's just a small fraction of things that I personally do on my Apple Watch daily.

What Apple Watch **doesn't** have, however, is an easy access to mindless doomscrolling apps.

And even though there is, apparently, a Reddit client for Apple Watch, using it to browse the website is anything but comfortable.

## Caveats

Now, obviously, Apple Watch can not be used independently from an iPhone. You also can't pair it with an iPad or a Mac – it has to be paired to an iPhone. 

That being said, after you activate the Watch and go through the initial setup, you don't really need to take out your iPhone for any of the core functions. And if you have an LTE variant of the Watch, you'll also be able to receive calls, send messages and use Internet without being tethered to an iPhone.

Making and receiving calls without Bluetooth earbuds can also be suboptimal. The person on the other side will always be put 'on speaker', and you'll have to get used to lifting your arm for prolonged periods of time. 

This can also be beneficial – one on hand (pun not intended), you'll always have a way out of unpleasant conversations ("sorry, my arm is getting tired, talk to you later"), and if you do end up having a lot of long phone conversation on the Watch, you will eventually develop pretty impressive arm strength. Just don't forget to swap the arm every once in a while :)

If you have a GPS model of the Watch, you'll also still have to keep your iPhone around in order for the Watch to have cellular connectivity. Maybe relegating it from your trouser pocket to the bottom of the backpack could be a good compromise?
